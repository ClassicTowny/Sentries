# Sentry
Citizens2 Town Sentry Character

This is my own re-working of the Sentry codebase, with mcmonkey4eva's blessing.

COMPLETED:-
* tidying codebase up for readability.
* updated the code to remove uses of deprecated methods from dependencies.

ONGOING:-
* re-organising the code to improve performance in critical sections.
* improve flexibility (especially with regard to interfacing with other plugins).

TODO:-
* finish interface for other plugins
* move all appropriate code into classes implementing this interface.
* rework the command handling to improve UX.
* add more features... 

(pls post any suggestions as issues and/or PR's)
